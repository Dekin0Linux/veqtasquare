                similarities to prepaid credit cards. Where both can be linked
                to a crypto wallet, prepaid cards are loaded with a set amount,
                while crypto debit cards draw from portfolio holdings as a
                funding source. In other words, once a prepaid card is depleted
                of funds, it often cannot be topped up; crypto debit cards enjoy
                repeated use as long as digital assets remain available to
                complete purchases. Our Crypto credit cards will function
                identically to traditional credit cards issued by Banks. in
                that, transactions are completed in exchange for debt to be paid
                off at a later date. Purchases made on products or services with
                our crypto credit cards, can be deferred over a certain period,
                allowing for payment at a later date. Typically, participants
                who opt for our crypto credit card options, must pay off a
                portion of their balance every month, or risk incurring late
                fees and interestâ€¦. Why use a crypto debit or credit card There

              <p className="text-gray-400 pt-4">
              Additional security: Crypto debit cards often employ standard security measures, like chip-and-pin technology, and demand multi-factor authentication before completing transactions;<br /><br />
